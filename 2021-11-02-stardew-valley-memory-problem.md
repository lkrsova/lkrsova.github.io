Crafting systems are an essential set of mechanics of most modern games, including Minecraft, a myriad of survival games, or cozy and fluffy farming sims like Stardew Valley. As much as it crafts (pun intended!) a wholesome experience for a player, it can cause an extra cognitive burden for a player. 

### Crafting systems
Crafting systems is a collection of game mechanics which allow a player to build virtual objects within a game. Since it enables a player to interact with objects within a game to create something new, useful or necessary to advance a gameplay, it is a fairly common system implemented in most modern games. If it's a good or bad thing is up to the reader's discretion.

Examples of using a crafting system range from making tools like a pickaxe or sword to building machines and elaborate structures. A player either follows a set of recipes or is given a free hand in figuring out combinations of materials or objects to create something new[^1]. When a player gathers enough materials listed in a recipe they build an object accordingly. Rinse. Repeat.

In some cases a player needs to wait a certain amount of time for an object to be created and fully usable within the game world. As a matter of fact this waiting time can be perceived in different dimensions. That's why we differentiate between four dimensions of time -- real-world time, gameworld time, coordination time, and fictive time[^2].

On a cogntivie level, crafting can also enforce analytical thinking and playfulness. After all, crafting is a creative endeavor present in many variations in the real life as well.
