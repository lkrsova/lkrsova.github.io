 I want to look at the case of one of the early secondary quests of **<a href="https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3" target="_blank">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>**, called **Wandering in The Dark**. I loved the environment design and immersive experience of this level, but I equally disliked the frequency of facing difficult enemies so early on in the game without any sort of preparation or warning. This post is not at all an expert view, rather just a bunch of personal notes about **facing difficulties in a game as a newcomer to the franchise**.

### Where are we in the game?
You completed all the side quests and points of interest (‚ùî on the map) in the **White Orchard**. You are now moving into another stage of Witcher's story which is in Velen, a war-torn swampland under Nilfgaardian occupation. 

Experience-wise you are most likely on a **level 4 or 5**. In the Witcher world, it means that you might have gained some experience with fighting packs of wolves or wild dogs, angry bandits, out-of-nowhere spawning drowners, or a group of ghouls scattered over a battlefield. And that's about it.

*White Orchard is one of the best onboardings genuinely incorporated into a game*

You're not up to the quest resource-wise or knowledge-wise regarding concoctions or potions especially. You have none or minimal fighting experiences; you don't know much about potion making and how to use them during a fight; nor about fighting tactics you might have learned through facing an advanced enemy.

Also, some players at this stage haven't found their way to the **Bestiary system** of the game. The system is a crucial component for Geralt's well-being and your survival.

In short, you are facing this quest unprepared.

### Narrative design
Wandering in the Dark is a secondary quest helping drive the main story forward. There is no way how to avoid it, skip it, or in any other way pretend that it doesn't exist. On top of that, you cannot leave the area until you are done with the level. You are indeed wandering in the dark.

The level starts on the easy end when you try to figure out a way to catch up with the Wild Hunt's company. Upon entering into a cave system with ancient elven ruins, you see them entering a portal and leaving the place. Accompanied by your friend, a powerful sorceress Keira Metz, you decide to chase after them to prevent them from finding Ciri.

Unfortunately for you, some things go awry and you are stuck in the dungeon, stuck there to figure out your way out as well as finding clues about Ciri's whereabouts with riddles scattered all over the place.

### Level design & enemies

You realize quite quickly that this little hiccup on the road soon develops into long hours of you fighting, rolling, dodging, and using other tricks to defeat all the enemies lurking in the dark.

Just for the illustration and not necessarily in this particular order, you have to fight all these monsters:

+ bunch of **drowners**;
+ one or two **foglets** (this is the first time you meet them);
+ **rats** nests (because Keira, the powerful sorceress, is afraid of them...);
+ more **drowners**, plus **wraiths** on a toxic & explosive field of mushrooms;
+ **clones of Geralt and Keira** (only if you fail to solve a Kelpie riddle);
+ **golem** (big and angry one, takes ages to take down!);
+ **gargoyle** (only if you turn in the wrong direction, takes ages to take down too);
+ **White Hunt's dogs** coming at you from 3 portals while your movement is limited by a protective shield;
+ **Nithral** aka the final boss of this level.

Personally, I had an issue with the pacing of this level. Most of the enemies a player faces are way above his/her level, forcing a player to spend a lot of time grinding through each of the stages and quite often replaying them over and over again. This become tedious and without the resources also almost impossible to master.

The problem is that the gameplay doesn't let you take a break or take in some deep and much needed air. Just a glimpse <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thewitcher3/comments/4m9ls2/a_rant_on_the_level_design_of_wandering_in_the/">at Reddit</a> or comments section under any YouTube walkthrough of this quest shows you how frustrating this part of the game is for many. Some players even abandoned playing the game entirely because of this quest. They just didn't see a way to succeed in the game. Some players also probably thought that the game will get progressively more difficult which is (suprisingly) not the case.

As much as this level might have been designed as the first rite of passage for a player, **I believe this is also the one which makes people give up on the game and hate it in the long run**. I'm glad I am the former example, although there were many moments I was inclining towards the latter one.

### A sidenote about a narrative dissonance
A **narrative dissonance happens when a game gives you a certain information but it is not reflected or is entirely ignored in the game**. In this case it's the issue of Keira Metz being a powerful sorceress.

As the Witcher lore says, Keira is one of the powerful sorceresses from the Lodge. That makes her one of the most skilled mages in the Witcher world. You would assume she should be rather helpful in fights but as it soon turns out, it's not the case. First, she's afraid of rats (gender stereotypes aside...), then she is not particularly helpful in any of the upcoming fights. The only exception is when she helps you fighting Wild Hunt's dogs by creating a shield around you. And that's about it.

Interestingly enough, one of the CD Projekt RED developer's disclosed he is aware of this issue too. His solution? He modded Keira's power abilities to match her lore background.

### Fun fact from Google Trends
In December 2019, Netflix released a long-awaited The Witcher series with Henry Cavill portraying Geralt of Rivia. It caused such **a global hype that the sales of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt went 554% up[^1] around the time of the TV show release**. As a consequence and illustration that people struggle with the same game levels even years after the original release, **Google showed that the searching for the Wandering in The Dark quest went up around the same time**.

Coincidentally, the same spike showed up for *Wild at Heart* quest. It is not that much of a surprise since this quest is the first time players runs into a werewolf. Especially his quickly recharging health bar is a problem to overcome effectively, usually only with the knowledge found online.
