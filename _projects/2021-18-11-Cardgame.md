During a game design couse by <a href="https://www.gamedevhub.cz/">Game Dev Hub</a> that I attended in 2021, one of the projects were to design a game card for a non-specific game. As instructed in the rubrics we were to include a picture, class, name of our character, HP and other stats, while lore or any backstory of a character written on the card was optional.

My character is a royal assassin class from the race of Vulpurs. Vulpurs are a fictional race which are highly-skilled assassins-to-hire I developed for a gamebook The Outer Rims I've been writing. I wanted him to be in a style of desolated/cyberpunk sci-fi and wanted the card to portray one of the characters who inhabits the world. For the card design exercise, I borrowed a picture drew by <a href="https://www.idea-academy.eu/concept-art-nivanh-chanthara-en">Nivanth Chanthara, a concept artist at EIDOS Montreal</a>. His imagery is impeccable and on different occasions it's been a source of my inspiration.
