During a game design couse by <a href="https://www.gamedevhub.cz/">Game Dev Hub</a> that I attended in 2021, one of the projects were to design a game card for a non-specific game. As instructed in the rubrics we were to include a picture, class, name of our character, HP and other stats, while lore or any backstory of a character written on the card was optional.

My character is a royal assassin class from the race of Vulpurs. Vulpurs are a fictional race which are highly-skilled assassins-to-hire I developed for a gamebook The Outer Rims I've been writing. I wanted them to be in a style of a desolated/cyberpunk sci-fi and wanted the card to portray one of the characters who inhabits the world.

I incorporated on the card most of the elements that are commonly present on gathering card games like Might & Magic. There's a a class symbol and name, card and attribute cost (power), ability name and its description, as well as short flavor text for the worldbuilding.

While designing the card I followed visual hierarchy principles[^1] and natural eye movement when we scan a picture we look at. Important elements of the card are bigger than others so they immediately "pop". I also made sure there's a natural Z or F pattern on the card.

All three final designs are a product of iterative process of tweaking the previous versions. I tweaked some colors to create a bigger contrast, positioning of elements, and some minor aesthetics.

For the card design exercise, I used a picture drew by <a href="https://www.idea-academy.eu/concept-art-nivanh-chanthara-en">Nivanth Chanthara, a concept artist at EIDOS Montreal</a>. His imagery is impeccable and on different occasions it's been a source of my inspiration.
