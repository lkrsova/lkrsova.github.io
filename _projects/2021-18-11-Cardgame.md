During a game design couse by <a href="https://www.gamedevhub.cz/">Game Dev Hub</a> that I attended in 2021, one of the projects were to design a game card for a non-specific game. As instructed in the rubrics we were to include a picture, class, name of our character, HP and other stats, while lore or any backstory of a character written on the card was optional.


My character is a royal assassin class from the race of Vulpurs. I wanted him to be in a style of desolated/cyberpunk sci-fi. I wanted the card to portray one of the characters who inhabits a world of The Outer Rims I created for my gamebook I've been writing. For this exercise, I borrowed a picture drew by Nivanth Chanthara. His imagery is impeccable and on different occasions it's been a source of my inspiration.
