I'm becoming more and more interested in what it means to create an immersive and well-designed environments for games or stories. That's why I was super excited when I discovered **Inkarnate**[^1], a tool for creating fantasy inspired environments, battle or world maps.

Inspired by watching <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s02">The Witcher season 2</a> (not as good as the first one, #bookswerebetter) I wanted to create a cavern of a hermit/warrior who lives in a solitude in his own space. So I created **Hermit's Cavern**.

The idea is that a hermit who lives in these quarters has built everything for himself from scratch using the environment around him to its fullest potential. The hermit here is an experienced warrior and scholar (paladin maybe?) who is on a quest to find a mysterious artefact. He often sits down by his small table and reads old scrolls to learn more about his quest. He uses the cavern water stream to drink, fish or just for bathing. From time to time he needs to go to the nearby village to get other supplies.

Sleeping place is elevated but he can see the entrance in case someone comes in unexpectedly. He also has a dog which helps guarding the cavern. The hermit used all the fur from creatures he killed either on his path or in his cavern when he entered it for the first time a long time ago. The fur now serves as coverings for him to sleep under.

For those who pay close attention, there is a nod to the old tale about how Odysey fought a Cyclope (sheep inside the cavern). And there's also a bathtub which is a nod to The Witcher game franchise and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJLs0VyMb5I">the iconic scene</a>.
