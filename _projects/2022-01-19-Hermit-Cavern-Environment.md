I'm becoming more and more interested in what it means to create an immersive and well-designed environments for games or stories. That's why I was super excited when I discovered Inkarnate[^1], a tool for creating fantasy inspired environments, battle or world maps.

Inspired by watching The Witcher season 2 (not as good as the first one, #bookswerebetter) I wanted to create a cavern of a hermit/warrior who lives in a solitude in his own cavern. So I created Hermit's Cavern.
