I'm becoming more and more interested in what it means to create an immersive and well-designed environments for games or stories. That's why I was super excited when I discovered **Inkarnate**[^1], a tool for creating fantasy inspired environments, battle or world maps.

Inspired by watching The Witcher season 2 (not as good as the first one, #bookswerebetter) I wanted to create a cavern of a hermit/warrior who lives in a solitude in his own space. So I created Hermit's Cavern.

The idea is that a hermit who lives in these quarters has built everything for himself and used fully what the environment had to offer. The hermit could be an old warrior + scholar (paladin maybe?) who is on a quest to find a mysterious artefact. That's why there's a table with scrolls. He uses the cavern water stream to drink, fish or just use for bathing. From time to time he needs to go to the nearby village to get other supplies.

Sleeping place is elevated but you can see the entrance in case someone comes in. He also has a dog which helps guarding the cavern. The hermit used all the fur from creatures he killed on his path or in his cavern when he had entered it for the first time. 

For those who pay close attention, there is a nod to the old tale about how Odysey fought a Cyclope (sheep inside the cavern). And there's also a bathtub which is a nod to The Witcher game franchise and the now iconic scene.
