### Design goal:
Have a playable and spatially readable level with a minimalistic gameplay scripted using Blueprints. Player's objective is to gather items, solve basic enviromental puzzles, and interact with NPCs who guide the player.

As this is my first playable project made with UE5 I used this opportunity to learn how to navigate UE5 and get familiar with LD tools and Blueprints respectively.

### Process

#### Initial sketch

I sketched the initial layout on a paper, which works well for me to jot basic ideas for a level I want to design.

In early stages of the sketch I wanted to have a starting area where player can orient themselves and understand the basic gameplay mechanics, then move them into a a small settlement and lead them to a focal point elevated above the village.
