### Design goal:
Have a playable and spatially readable level with a minimalistic gameplay scripted using Blueprints. Player's objective is to gather items, solve basic enviromental puzzles, and interact with NPCs who guide the player.

As this is my first playable project made with UE5 I used this opportunity to learn how to navigate UE5 and get familiar with basci tools and Blueprints.

### Process

#### Initial sketch

I sketched the initial layout on a paper, which works well for me to jot basic ideas for a level I want to design.

Here we have a small settlement as an open area for the player to explore. In early stages of sketches I wanted to have a focal point elevated above the village, both to have a landmark and to practice how to navigate player to it.

#### Tweaking focal points

Entrance & enclosed space



Landmark (windmill)

### Level design & enemies

You realize quite quickly that this little hiccup on the road soon develops into long hours of you fighting, rolling, dodging, and using other tricks to defeat all the enemies lurking in the dark.

Just for the illustration and not necessarily in this particular order, you have to fight all these monsters:

+ bunch of **drowners**;
+ one or two **foglets** (this is the first time you meet them);
+ **rats** nests (because Keira, the powerful sorceress, is afraid of them...);
+ more **drowners**, plus **wraiths** on a toxic & explosive field of mushrooms;


#### Applied assets
Unreal Engine 5 (for meshes and Blueprints)
