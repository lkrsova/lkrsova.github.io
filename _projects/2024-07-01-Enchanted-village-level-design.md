### Design goal:
Have a playable and spatially readable level with a minimalistic gameplay scripted using Blueprints. Player's objective is to gather items, solve basic enviromental puzzles, and interact with NPCs who guide the player.

As this is my first playable project made with UE5 I used this opportunity to learn how to navigate UE5 and get familiar with LD tools and Blueprints respectively.

### Process

#### Initial sketch

I sketched the initial layout on a paper, which works well for me to jot basic ideas for a level I want to design.

Here we have a small settlement as an open area for the player to explore. In early stages of sketches I wanted to have a focal point elevated above the village, both to have a landmark and to practice how to navigate player to it.
