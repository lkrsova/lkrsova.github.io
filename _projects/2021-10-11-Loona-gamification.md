Loona is marketed on the Apple store as ‚Äúthe first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep‚Äù. Its goal is to help users wind down before going to bed. It does so by guiding its user to color a 3D scenery by following instructions contained in a narrated 20-minute long immersive story.

## How it works
The app recommends its user a new 3D scenery (‚Äúa sleepscape‚Äù) every day. Sometimes it‚Äôs a standalone story, sometimes it‚Äôs an episode from a themed series. The setting of the scenery can also differ. It might be a realistic story from Brooklyn infused with some fantasy elements, the other times it‚Äôs a fairytale-like adventure, or a short trip to an exotic destination.

Each scenery is rendered in 3D. The starting color of all the elements of the scene is grey. Upon touching each of the components change into a predefined color. As the story goes, the user is encouraged to color specific components of a scenery. This repeats until all of them are colored and the progress bar above the scenery reaches 100%. In a goodbye screen, the user is informed about how many mindful minutes they have reached and what their streak of finished sleepscapes is.

## What Loona does well & where it has its limits
Loona‚Äôs gamification features are subtle. Apart from the coloring itself, unlocking another scene as a reward for finishing others, there are also mini games placed in the scenes, usually in the form of clearing an old picture from dust. Someone might even argue that apart from the streak screen it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of gamification features we usually see in mobile apps these days (i.e. leaderboard, achievements, badges, etc.).

However, coloring books are one of the most common children's games and they‚Äôve gotten popular in recent years through a trend of anti-stress coloring books and color-by-numbers apps for both kids and adults. Loona is a variation of that enriched with a mental health focused layer. It doesn‚Äôt need too many gamification features to be working well for its purpose.

Visuals of Loona app are gentle in color, textures, and sounds also co-create the calm atmosphere. This all, in my opinion, goes well with the goal of this app. If I had a choice, though, I would add badges as a reward for successfully completing a series of scenes, mainly to motivate users to use the app frequently or when their interest and motivation weathers.

I would have some critiques about the app's UI/UX (finding a hint option happens accidentally) and limited customization options regarding accessibility. I would let users pick a narrator (male/female), control the pace of narration, maybe even add an option to color by numbers would be beneficial and fun for some users who have a hard time finding all the components.
