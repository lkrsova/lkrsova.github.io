### So, you study and design games, huh?
Yes. I’ve been always interested in how people make sense of technologies around them and how their experience is designed. Intrigued by pop cultural phenomena like Terminator, Short Circuit or The Matrix, I've been fascinated by artificial intelligence since I was a little kid. What entices me the most is what we perceive as "believable" or "authentic" while interacting with an anthropomorphised AI, be it an avatar or NPCs in video games.

I focus mainly on understanding how gamers perceive NPCs in video games, what makes them believable to interact with, and what strategies players develop, for example in the combat, to be succesfu in their gameplay. Since part of my PhD training dwells in the domain of information science, I also pay attention to what sources players use to support their success in gameplay walkthroughs.

As a game designer, I am responsible of non-player characters and what they do in the world to be the most authentic in a given setting. As a researcher I seek to support my work with recent findings from human-computer interaction, AI in video games, robotics, and game design more broadly.

### Do you play games, too? Me as a player
Yup. Though I wouldn't call myself a gamer, I do love playing video games for fun and educative purposes alike. The more games I play the better tools I have to design them. The more tools I have the more I understand what makes their design impactful. 

I appreciate video games mainly for their interactive affordances and qualities - they allow me to be in charge of the story and co-create what's going to happen to my character. They allow for a play, fun, and impactful experiences. They also offer a unique way how to escape mundane things and experience something that would not be possible. On top of that, I enjoy analyzing their level design. All this while having a huge appreciation for all the hard work put in them. 

Video games are closely connected to my i


that excites me the most are the ones which put players in the center of their design by creating an immersive experience. Since immersion is closely connected to human-like NPCs and realistic game worlds, that’s also the broader interest of my research.




### Video games in general
My **favorite games are the ones which put players in the center of the design by creating an immersive experience** using narrative and thoughtfully designed experience. I am also a huge fan of indie games and I applaud all the game developers for putting their work out there just because they love developing games.

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first Mass Effect came out. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/mobile">Call of Duty Mobile</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/">Life is Strange</a>, and hidden objects & mini-puzzles <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=FIVE-BN%20GAMES">Lost Lands game series</a>. Currently, I am exploring different genres of games - open-world RPGs like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey/">Assassin's Creed: Odyssey</a>, and pixel art farming/crafting sims (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/Graveyard_Keeper/">Graveyard Keeper</a>, anyone?) being my all time favorite.

I love **connecting with people and learning from the experts in the field**. That's why I hang out with & am member of:
- <a href="https://igda.org/">IGDA (International Game Developers Association)</a>,
- <a href="https://grux.org/">IGDA Games Research & User Experience Special Interest Group</a>,
- and I occassionaly contribute to <a href="https://interfaceingame.com/">Interface of Game</a>

I am a proud patreon of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/noclip">NoClip productions</a> and I believe you should become a one too!

If you want to hang out, let me know! You can also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067795186/">find me on Steam as leeloo</a>.

## Outside of Academia

### Game design
When my PhD obligations permits, I am learning the ropes of game design with game design professionals in a <a href="https://www.gamedevhub.cz/">GameDevHub Game Design course</a>. I get a kick from creating something from scratch that could make people happy.

### "I'm a bit of a painter myself."
I'm an overall an artistic person. In “offline” world far from computer screens, I enjoy water coloring and crafting in general. I love anything pop culture from a blockbuster movie to the recent social media trend.

When pandemic is not a thing I travel quite a bit. In my free time I have fun while cooking, reading, yoga.
