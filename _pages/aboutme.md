## Research-wise

### Algorithms & Datafication

**I used to work in companies handling personal data harvested from social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.** At some point I wasn’t okay with the unethical dimensions of this type of work and joined the other ("Light") side of research. I moved both physically and mentally from Europe to the USA to follow a path that allows me to ask and work on fun research questions and problems.

I am always interested in how people make sense of technology and how their experience with it is designed. Right now I am researching AI in video games and how gamers perceive believability of NPCs in story driven open world games like Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,

From the topics of datafication and data surveillance, **I extended my interest to algorithms and how these help (or not) design the experience for thousands of people**. Currently, I am interested in learning more about the **intersection of recommmendation algorithms, datafication, data literacy and pop culture**.



### Video games & UX/Design Research

I am interested in user experience (UX) and design of video games as an experience that helps us escape from our mundane worlds and deal with unprecedented situations.

My favorite games are the ones which put gamers in the center of the design by creating an immersive experience using narrative and thoughtfully designed experience. I am currently working on finalizing my way through The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt by completing all the POIs in the game. When the Slavic folklore and being a gritty monster hunter become mundane (which doesn't happen often), I am on the quest of exploring the beautiful Ancient Greece in Assassins Creed: Odyssey. I am also a huge fan of indie games and I applaud all the game developers for putting their work out there just because they love developing games.

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first Mass Effect came out. I used to play games including first-person shooters like DOOM, Quake, Heretic, Duke Nukem 3D; strategy games like Sid Meier’s Colonization and Civilization, Age of Empires, Caesar III, Tycoons; RPG games like Mafia, Diablo II; and adventure games including Czech Polda, Veil of Darkness, and others.

I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through Call of Duty Mobile, Life is Strange, and hidden objects & mini-puzzles Lost Lands game series.

I love connecting with people and learning from the experts. That's why I hang out with & am member of:

## Outside of Academia

### Game testing & development

When my PhD obligations permits, I am a game tester and localization translator for games and software. I am also learning the ropes of game design with Unity and UI/UX design with Adobe XD.

I really enjoy environment design and GUI, and can spend endless hours creating pastures, mountains, and other types of landscape (usually with pre-made assets).

### "I'm a bit of a painter myself."
In “offline” world far from computer screens and my PhD, I enjoy water coloring, traveling, cooking, reading, yoga, movies, and playing basketball with my basketball proficient boyfriend Cole.
