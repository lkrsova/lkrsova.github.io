### Algorithms, AI & believability of NPCs

I am always interested in how people make sense of technology and how their experience with it is designed. Right now I am researching AI in video games and how gamers perceive believability of NPCs in story driven open world games like Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,

**I used to work in companies handling personal data harvested from social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.** At some point I wasn’t okay with the unethical dimensions of this type of work and joined the other ("Light") side of research. I moved both physically and mentally from Europe to the USA to follow a path that allows me to ask and work on fun research questions and problems.

From the topics of datafication and data surveillance, **I extended my interest to algorithms and how these help (or dont') design the experience for thousands of people**. Currently, I am interested in learning more about the **intersection of algorithms, video games, and storytelling**.


### Video games in general

I am interested in user experience and design of video games as an experience that helps us escape from our mundane worlds and deal with unprecedented situations.

My **favorite games are the ones which put players in the center of the design by creating an immersive experience** using narrative and thoughtfully designed experience. I am also a huge fan of indie games and I applaud all the game developers for putting their work out there just because they love developing games.

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first Mass Effect came out. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through Call of Duty Mobile, Life is Strange, and hidden objects & mini-puzzles Lost Lands game series. Currently, I am exploring different genres of games - open-world RPGs like Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Assassin's Creed, and pixel art farming/crafting sims (Graveyard Keeper, anyone?) being my always favorite.

I love **connecting with people and learning from the experts in the field**. That's why I hang out with & am member of:
- <a href="https://igda.org/">IGDA (International Game Developers Association)</a>,
- <a href="https://grux.org/">IGDA Games Research & User Experience Special Interest Group</a>,
- and I occassionaly contribute to <a href="https://interfaceingame.com/">Interface of Game</a>

I am a proud patreon of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/noclip">NoClip productions</a> and I believe you should become a one too!

## Outside of Academia

### Game design

When my PhD obligations permits, I am learning the ropes of game design with Unity and GameDevHub courses.

### "I'm a bit of a painter myself."
In “offline” world far from computer screens and my PhD, I enjoy water coloring, anything pop culture, traveling, cooking, reading, yoga, movies, and playing basketball with my basketball proficient boyfriend Cole.
