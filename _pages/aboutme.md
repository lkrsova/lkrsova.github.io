### Algorithms, AI & believability of NPCs

I am always interested in how people make sense of technology and how their experience with it is designed. Right now **I focus on AI in video games and how gamers perceive believability of NPCs** in story driven open world games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,

**I used to work in companies handling personal data harvested from social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.** At some point I wasn’t okay with the unethical dimensions of this type of work and joined the other ("Light") side of research. I moved both physically and mentally from Europe to the USA to follow a path that allows me to ask and work on fun research questions and problems.

From the topics of datafication and data surveillance, **I extended my interest to algorithms and how these help (or dont') design the experience for thousands of people**. Currently, I am interested in learning more about the **intersection of algorithms, video games, and storytelling**.


### Video games in general

I am interested in user experience and design of video games as an experience that helps us escape from our mundane worlds and deal with unprecedented situations.

My **favorite games are the ones which put players in the center of the design by creating an immersive experience** using narrative and thoughtfully designed experience. I am also a huge fan of indie games and I applaud all the game developers for putting their work out there just because they love developing games.

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first Mass Effect came out. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/mobile">Call of Duty Mobile</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/">Life is Strange</a>, and hidden objects & mini-puzzles <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=FIVE-BN%20GAMES">Lost Lands game series</a>. Currently, I am exploring different genres of games - open-world RPGs like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey/">Assassin's Creed: Odyssey</a>, and pixel art farming/crafting sims (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/Graveyard_Keeper/">Graveyard Keeper</a>, anyone?) being my all time favorite.

I love **connecting with people and learning from the experts in the field**. That's why I hang out with & am member of:
- <a href="https://igda.org/">IGDA (International Game Developers Association)</a>,
- <a href="https://grux.org/">IGDA Games Research & User Experience Special Interest Group</a>,
- and I occassionaly contribute to <a href="https://interfaceingame.com/">Interface of Game</a>

I am a proud patreon of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/noclip">NoClip productions</a> and I believe you should become a one too!

If you want to hang out, let me know! You can also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067795186/">find me on Steam as leeloo</a>.

## Outside of Academia

### Game design

When my PhD obligations permits, I am learning the ropes of game design with game design professionals in <a href="https://www.gamedevhub.cz/">GameDevHub courses</a>.
