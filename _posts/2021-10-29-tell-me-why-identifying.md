Some video games have almost transcendental qualities. They take their player to the worlds and through expriences they would not normally be able to live. Tell Me Why does that with main two topics -- gender transitioning, and overcoming childhood trauma. As heavy as these topics sounds, Tell Me Why does an amazing job to show them in a loving and brave way, showing a player there's always multiple perspectives needed to be taken in an account.
