The primary objective of level design is to clearly communicate to players where they have to go or what they can or cannot do within a level. Color coding and lighting are just two of some level design techniques using visual cues to convey design intent or highlight important parts of a level. You have most likely encountered cases of such techniques. Recently published Stray (Annapurna Interactive) gives a lot of good examples. In this post I'm adding some science behind it to help explain why it works the way it does.

### The theory behind 

#### Perceptual salience

#### Von Restorff effect

#### Attentional set

our brains lack the horsepower to process everything in our field of vision, they compensate by filtering out things that don’t match what we’re searching for. The result is that unexpected or odd objects may actually go unseen even if we’re looking right at them. The guy who almost hit me looked right at me, but he didn’t see me because he was looking for other cars to see if it was safe to pull out, not someone on foot. I wasn’t in what psychologists call his “attentional set.”

We see color coding all the time in video games, often to aid us in navigation.

Once you’ve been trained to be on the lookout for yellow doors, you’ll start to notice anything that’s yellow because your mind is latching on to a certain heuristic to help govern what visual information is ignored and what is processed.

If you’re a game designer and want to put a little sparkle or shine effect on a health or ammo kit to make it noticeable, the choice of color matters. Consistency between this color and the color used to offer navigation cues will help players notice both.

On the flipside, if you want to keep some secret area from being too easily discovered, use different colors and unexpected shapes.

On the opposite side, when something blends in the -- players are more likely to look right at unexpected objects or environmental features without seeing them.

Navigating with color, size, position 

Color coding

In most games you find things like climbable surfaces are all highlighted using a coloured texture which not only indicates that they can be climbed but it also highlights the path that the player should climb. Rime, God of War, Tomb Raider and Uncharted all do this to help guide the player forwards. 

Lighting

### Examples from video games

#### Yellow signifiers

#### Don't forget about gorillas

Invisible gorilla effect

Many action-driven games such as Tomb Raider, Uncharted or The Last of Us use yellow or its shades to communicate to player about affordances of objects around them, their climbability or 

Attention-grabbing: Since yellow is the most visible color, it is also the most attention-getting color. Yellow can be used in a small amount to draw notice, such as on traffic signs or advertisements.

There's an insider joke running around the community of level designers pointing out the glaring 



Hue, saturation, and value can all be used to call attention to areas or objects within an interface, and de-emphasize others.
Size. Object size and proportion to surrounding elements creates visual hierarchy, both in interactive elements like buttons, but also within informative elements like text.
Position. An object's orientation or spatial arrangement in relation to the surrounding objects creates differentiation to invite action.

How are these represent in video games? Let's have a look:

In just recently published game Stray [Annapurna Interactive], you navigate a cyberpunk-looking city as a cat. Without any map or previous knowledge about the place level designers used as many techniques to get a player from point A to point B in a way that's just cognitively challenging enough to play this game as a relaxing no-brainer after a tough day at work. What's the technique and why does it work in Stray so well? Let's dive into it.
