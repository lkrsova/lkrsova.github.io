Navigating player across a level in as non-disruptive way as possible is the goal of all level designers. The premise stands that people's attention draws to visual salient stimuli. There's a bit of cognitive science behind this fact, so let's dive into it and see how it is represented in level design.


### The theory behind 

#### Perceptual salience

#### Von Restorff effect

Navigating with color, size, position


### Examples from video games

#### Yellow signifiers

Many action-driven games such as Tomb Raider, Uncharted or The Last of Us use yellow or its shades to communicate to player about affordances of objects around them, their climbability or 

Attention-grabbing: Since yellow is the most visible color, it is also the most attention-getting color. Yellow can be used in a small amount to draw notice, such as on traffic signs or advertisements.

There's an insider joke running around the community of level designers pointing out the glaring 



Hue, saturation, and value can all be used to call attention to areas or objects within an interface, and de-emphasize others.
Size. Object size and proportion to surrounding elements creates visual hierarchy, both in interactive elements like buttons, but also within informative elements like text.
Position. An object's orientation or spatial arrangement in relation to the surrounding objects creates differentiation to invite action.

How are these represent in video games? Let's have a look:
