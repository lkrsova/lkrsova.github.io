The primary objective of level design is to clearly communicate to players where they have to go or what they can or cannot do within a level. Color coding and lighting are just two of some level design techniques relying on visual perception to convey design intent or highlight important parts of a level. Recently released [Stray](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/), where you play as a cat finding its way back home, gives a lot of good examples of such techniques. In this post I'm adding some science behind it to help explain why it works the way it does.

#### The cat is out of the bag
One thing that immediately struck me about *Stray* is how effectively their designers used light and color coding to navigate player throughout the complex, highly vertical and dense cyberpunk city. True, oftentimes it's a bit too much on the nose but it also makes the game less demanding or taxing on player's cognitive capacity (apart from the puzzles, which I'm not gonna cover).

Right at the beginning, when you land on all four from an unexpected fall, you find yourself in a dark, dimly lit gutter. The only thing you see is both real and proverbial light in the distance, signaling where you need to be headed next. As you ponder about your next steps, a cutscene interrupts your contemplation and a blinking orange light appears over the door, which abruptly opens and shows you the way out.

This is just one of the cases where level design of Stray uses color coding and light to navigate its players on an intended path. Below is a couple of examples of what I mean -- notice neon signs, lit spaces, and other ways that rely on a cognitive bias called **perceptual salience**.

### The theory behind it all
As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://lenikrsova.github.io/blog/leveldesign-resources), game and level design specifically are backed by findings from cognitive psychology and related phenomena. A lot of techniques that level designers employ intuitively, stem from research on human perception and cognition. The ones I'll talk about that explain how visual perception and thus player navigation in video games work are: perceptual salience, Von Restorff effect aka Isolation paradigm, attentional set, invisible gorilla effect, and some basics of color theory.

#### Perceptual salience
In neuroscience and adjacent fields, salience is a property or quality of something standing out from the rest. Saliency usually arises from the difference between an item an its neighbors, caused by a different color coding, light value, etc. In general, salience is used in the studies of human cognition and perception to refer to any aspect of a stimulus that stands out from the rest.

A couple of well-known biases are featured in the picture below from a study by Levia et al. [2020]. You might have not heard about them specifically but let's be honest, you did notice that your eyes track the same pattern as the heatmaps show on each of the pictures, right?

##### Why is this happening?
Despite people often realizing, human brain lacks one important quality -- it doesn't possess the horsepower to process everything at once. Human brain is highly selective to avoid overloading itself. Take your field of vision. In order to conserve energy your brain automatically filters out things that don't match what you're searching for.

This phenomena is called **attentional set**, and is formed when a subject learns that a set of rules can be applied to complex stimuli to differentiate relevant from irrelevant cues [Heisler et al., 2015]. This is the very reason why really good horror movies or video games know how to set up (visual) expectations and then break them at the right moment to surprise and scare their audience. 

#### Don't forget about gorillas
This focus on something that we expect also allows for the opposite effect. Unexpected or odd objecst that are out of the context of the place or are not within the attentional set, will fall through and might go unseen even if you're looking right at them. It's called "inattentional blindness" but you might have encountered it in popular science in a form of an experiment called the **invisible gorilla effect**, created by psychologists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris. Without spoiling too much, [watch this video to see what it's about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo). 

#### Color-coded attention
To some extent, the famous scene from The Matrix with the Lady in Red works on the same premise, so does multiplayer games such as Halo and your selective attention to the color of your opponent's uniforms. 

**Von Restorff effect aka isolation paradigm**

#### Application in video games

We see color coding all the time in video games, often to aid us in navigation.

Once you’ve been trained to be on the lookout for yellow doors, you’ll start to notice anything that’s yellow because your mind is latching on to a certain heuristic to help govern what visual information is ignored and what is processed.

If you’re a game designer and want to put a little sparkle or shine effect on a health or ammo kit to make it noticeable, the choice of color matters. Consistency between this color and the color used to offer navigation cues will help players notice both.

On the flipside, if you want to keep some secret area from being too easily discovered, use different colors and unexpected shapes.

On the opposite side, when something blends in the -- players are more likely to look right at unexpected objects or environmental features without seeing them.

Navigating with color, size, position 

Color coding

In most games you find things like climbable surfaces are all highlighted using a coloured texture which not only indicates that they can be climbed but it also highlights the path that the player should climb. Rime, God of War, Tomb Raider and Uncharted all do this to help guide the player forwards.

### Examples from video games

#### Yellow signifiers




Many action-driven games such as Tomb Raider, Uncharted or The Last of Us use yellow or its shades to communicate to player about affordances of objects around them, their climbability or 

Attention-grabbing: Since yellow is the most visible color, it is also the most attention-getting color. Yellow can be used in a small amount to draw notice, such as on traffic signs or advertisements.

There's an insider joke running around the community of level designers pointing out the glaring 

Hue, saturation, and value can all be used to call attention to areas or objects within an interface, and de-emphasize others.
Size. Object size and proportion to surrounding elements creates visual hierarchy, both in interactive elements like buttons, but also within informative elements like text.
Position. An object's orientation or spatial arrangement in relation to the surrounding objects creates differentiation to invite action.

How are these represent in video games? Let's have a look:
