Learning about UX/UI without actually designing a prototype is like learning to swim without stepping into water. Thankfully, there's tons of tools accesible and kind to beginners and to-be UX/UI designers. One of them is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>, which I've been using lately to learn basics of designing, prototyping and testing low-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes of (mostly) game-related designs.

*Prototyping and wiring is my favorite part of working with Adobe XD*

Recently, I run into a YouTube tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAbq1eKey19tt-FfaIO1RMA">Dansky</a> in which he explains step-by-step how to make a basic introductory game interface selecting a character to play as.

Using tutorials from Dansky and <a href="https://twitter.com/pingdani">Dani Beaumont</a> from Adobe, I designed and prototyped an alternative version of **Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** as if it was a game where you can choose between Geralt and Ciri to play their respective story.

*Use X, O, and arrow keys (left and right) accordingly to navigate through the prototype.*
 
I am not saying that <a href="https://en.cdprojektred.com/">CD Projekt RED</a> should make a game like this but... We can only hope, as they announced they started working on Witcher 4, there will be something like this in the Witcher universe soon?
