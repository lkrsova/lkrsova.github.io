Have you ever felt creeped out or even repulsed by a video game character but couldn’t really tell why? It happens when you subconciously hit a so-called **uncanny valley**, a phenomena when humans realize there is something off with the human-like looking entity in front of them.

### What is uncanny valley?
You have most like encountered this term already in relation to robots. Uncanny valley was coined by a Japanese robotics, [professor Masahiro Mori in the 1970s](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213238). His hypothesis was that the closer people get to the depiction of robots as humans, the affinity for them increases until we come into a "valley" where we feel uncomfortable to look at a thing or entity resembling a person (or its part). This valley is what we know as “uncanny valley” where people tend to get repulsed by the uncanny resemblance with a human.

By the way, uncanny valley is not a new thing. If we go even further in the history, the first discussion about uncanny valley has roots in a [1906 paper by Ernst Anton Jentsch, and even Sigmund Freud discussed it at the time](https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315850115.ch3). There they discuss specifically about a fear of automata, later heavily discussed as a part of cybernetics, a theory of systems, by experts such as C. Shannon, John von Neumann and alike.

In his paper, professor Mori provided a graph that covers most types of objects holding a human likeness and either missing or fulfilling it, including his remarks about movement deepening the uncanny valley significantly. There have been variations of the graph but the basics stay the same. Only recently some researchers suggested the valley might actually be a cliff [Bartneck et al., 2007].

#### Prosthetic origins
The original artefact Mori used was a prosthetic hand. Prosthetic hands, even in the 70s, had achieved a resemblance to the human form that looked on par with false teeth. Upon first glance artificial hands covered by a skin colored looking material seems human-like. But once a person hits the realization that the hand is actually artificial, they experience an eerie sensation. They usually get startled once they shake the hand - the unnatural behavior of the hand, including its coldness and boneless structure that doesn’t fit in the mental model of how a human hand should behave while interacting with it.

*Recent studies [Poliakoff et al., 2018] examined the perception of eeriness of human prosthetic hands to, once again, support or refute Mori's hypothesis.*

#### It gets worse with movement
As the graph shows, **uncanny valley gets even more prominent with movement**. People are in general so attuned and familiar to the natural flow of movements human bodies and their parts make that even the slightest difference can throw them into the uncanny valley.

Just think about all the examples from movies where the world is hit by a virus and the majority of the population becomes zombie. These creatures either tend to have jerky, jolting and in other way spasmic, uncoordinated movements, or are impossibly slow and drag themselves around. All of it seems so unnatural to the human eye, the audience, and hopefully the main protagonist as well, immediately recognize there's something off.

### Research says...
Different explanations investigated from biological, cognitive, and social roots tried explaining uncanny valley, but its origin is not conclusively confirmed. For that reason some researchers contest the existence of uncanny valley entirely.

What research has confirmed so far, though, there seems to be a generational and cultural divide and predispositions conencted to the phenomenon. For example, [some cultures are so accustomed to living with their dead ones](https://www.escape.com.au/destinations/asia/the-tribe-that-keeps-their-dead-relatives-at-home/image-gallery/6b4fc89987417563bd9f9f128131ec28?galleryimage=2) that one can argue their threshold for uncanny valley is most likely placed in a very different spot than the one of cultures burying their dead ones.

What is even more interesting, and confirms that uncanny valley is actually acquired not born with, is the phenomenon among children and their perception of robots. [Studies show that until the age of 9, children don't bat an eye over the fact a human-like looking robot might possess feelings and cognition](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-generational-divide-in-the-uncanny-valley-11547138712). It is plausible that the more contact children have with highly sophisticated types of robots or voice agents like Siri or Alexa, the more their generation will get accustomed to assumptions of AI having feelings and emotions. Therefore, the uncanny valley might eventually disappear.

#### What causes it then?
To be honest, we don't really know for sure. One of the approaches that aims to explain what happens when human interact with increasingly human-like characters claims that the discomfort comes from the *perceptual mismatch hypothesis* when a mismatch by inconsistent sensory cues happens (e.g. proportions of face features doesn’t match skin texture, etc.).



On the other hand, *theory of mind* might offer another explanation. Research has shown that the most problematic parts causing uncanny valley are particularly face and eye-related areas. Humans are tuned in to detect even small changes in facial expressions and eye movement and surrounding areas are the facial features used to assess other people’s mental states through. When for example a smile doesn’t match human anatomy, humans subconsciously assess that there is something off with the person and might feel repulsed by them. Then the capacity to understand others through theory of mind can be limited.

Research also shows that there is an effect between the prior familiarity with a character and uncanny valley, where the curve tends to be moderate for those characters previously known by the subject.

### Why should I care?
In video games in particular, the demand for bridging the uncanny valley by creating highly realistic animations is of the utmost importance because it can hinder player’s immersion. Also, to some extent it is the nature of game developers to challenge themselves and increase the realism of the game world and characters inhabiting them.

Players detecting uncanny valley while playing game tend to drop from the state of immersion. Immersion is a complex cognitive state so it might be broken by a myriad of things but when you’re developing a game with realistic human-like looking and behaving characters, this is not the way how you want to loose them.

*Some video games like Detroit: Become Human by Quantic Dream take advantage of uncanny valley phenomenon and use it to support their characters*

### How do I apply what I just read in the game development?

In video games specifically, you can spot it within animations including running -- I am personally expericing it now with a rather comical running in [*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-fallen-order)) - dancing, and more coordinate and complex set of movements. I would like to cover this topic in more depth in the future with an expert's insight from someone from animation and mocap departments, so stay tuned!

One of the ways to bypass this problem is to go through the path of stylization. Some of the elements of stylization that have the greatest impact on the attractiveness of characters are material properties or figures, the shape of characters determines mainly how realistic they appear. Sometimes uncanny valley is even desirable, especially in creation of deliberately repulsive characters.

*Characters from Disco Elysium are a good example how stylization helped make them more believable.*

As humans interact more with software agents, and come to rely on them more, it becomes increasingly important that the systems rely on the same interactional rules that humans do. The goal should not be “to make every interface anthropomorphic but the principles of spatialized interaction and embodied conversational agents might helpfully locate intelligence for users” [Cassell et al., 2000; Cassell, 2001]. Although believability is often named as the primary purpose behind embodying the interface, functions and properly conveyed social cues would appear to be more effective.




Test it and test it early. Especially the animation part will be the trickiest to manage.
Cases from video games

Creating, modeling and animating realistic human-like characters is immensely hard! With the progressively better technology, game studios do their best to deliver the best possible NPCs to their players. However, this not always goes according to the plan. Here are some of the examples of uncanny valley creeping out people, and further down you’ll find ones that players agreed upon to be not as creepy.
