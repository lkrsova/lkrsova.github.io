Have you ever felt creeped out or even repulsed by a video game character but couldn’t really tell why? It happens when you subconciously hit a so-called **uncanny valley**, a phenomena when humans realize there is something off with the human-like looking entity in front of them.

### What is uncanny valley?
You have most like encountered this term already in relation to robots. Uncanny valley was coined by a Japanese robotics professor Masahiro Mori in the 1970s. His hypothesis was that the closer people get to the depiction of robots as humans, the affinity for them increases until we come into a valley. This valley is what we know as “uncanny valley” where people tend to get repulsed by the uncanny resemblance with a human.

A good example is a prosthetic hand, which was the original artefact Mori used in his example.

Prosthetic hands, even in the 70s, had achieved a resemblance to the human form that looked on par with false teeth. However, once we hit the realization that the hand is actually artificial, we experience an eerie sensation. We can get startled by the unnatural behavior of the hand while shaking it, it’s coldness and boneless structure that doesn’t fit in our mental model of how a human hand should behave while interacting with it.

If we go even further in the history, the first discussion about uncanny valley has roots in a 1906 paper by Ernst Anton Jentsch, a German doctor. He talked about a fear of automata
What causes it?

That’s a very good question that even reserchers have not been able to crack in a satisfying way. There have been

### What does research say?
Interestingly enough, there also seems to be a generational divide [1]. As anecdotal as it sounds, two Christmas movies have been dividing family members
But I heard..

…that uncanny valley might be an uncanny cliff or might not exist at all, right? You’re correct. Since the phenomena is not fully understood and its occurence might heavily depend on subjectivity of a human, some research questions the existence of it.

### Why should I care?
In video games in particular, the demand for bridging the uncanny valley by creating
highly realistic animations is of the utmost importance because it can hinder player’s immersion.
Also, to some extent it is the nature of game developers to challenge themselves and increase the
realism of the world and characters inhabiting them.

Players detecting uncanny valley while playing game tend to drop from the state of immersion. Immersion is a complex cognitive state so it might be broken by a myriad of things but when you’re developing a game with realistic human0like looking and behaving characters, this is not the way how you want to loose them.

### How do I apply what I just read in the game development?
Test it and test it early. Especially the animation part will be the trickiest to manage.
Cases from video games

Creating, modeling and animating realistic human-like characters is immensely hard! With the progressively better technology, game studios do their best to deliver the best possible NPCs to their players. However, this not always goes according to the plan. Here are some of the examples of uncanny valley creeping out people, and further down you’ll find ones that players agreed upon to be not as creepy.
