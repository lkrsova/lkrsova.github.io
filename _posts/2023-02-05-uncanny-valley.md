Have you ever felt creeped out or even repulsed by a video game character but couldn’t really tell why? It happens when you subconciously hit a so-called **uncanny valley**, a phenomena when humans realize there is something off with the human-like looking entity in front of them.

### What is uncanny valley?
You have most like encountered this term already in relation to robots. Uncanny valley was coined by a Japanese robotics, [professor Masahiro Mori in the 1970s](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213238). His hypothesis was that the closer people get to the depiction of robots as humans, the affinity for them increases until we come into a "valley" where we feel uncomfortable to look at a thing or entity resembling a person (or its part). This valley is what we know as “uncanny valley” where people tend to get repulsed by the uncanny resemblance with a human.

Professor Mori even provided a graph that covers most types of objects holding a human likeness and either missing or fulfilling it:

A good example is a prosthetic hand, which was the original artefact Mori used in his example.

Prosthetic hands, even in the 70s, had achieved a resemblance to the human form that looked on par with false teeth. However, once we hit the realization that the hand is actually artificial, we experience an eerie sensation. We can get startled by the unnatural behavior of the hand while shaking it, it’s coldness and boneless structure that doesn’t fit in our mental model of how a human hand should behave while interacting with it.

If we go even further in the history, the first discussion about uncanny valley has roots in a [1906 paper by Ernst Anton Jentsch, and even Sigmund Freud discussed it at the time](https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315850115.ch3). He talked about a fear of automata,
What causes it?

That’s a very good question that even reserchers have not been able to crack in a satisfying way. There have been

### What does research say?
Different explanations investigated from biological, cognitive, and social roots tried explaining uncanny valley, but its origin is not conclusively confirmed. For that reason some researchers contest the existence of uncanny valley entirely or claim that the “valley” is actually a “cliff”. Interestingly enough, there also seems to be a generational and cultural divide. [Some cultures are so accustomed to be living with their dead ones](https://www.escape.com.au/destinations/asia/the-tribe-that-keeps-their-dead-relatives-at-home/image-gallery/6b4fc89987417563bd9f9f128131ec28?galleryimage=2) that one would argue their threshold of uncanny valley is most likely placed in a very different spot than the one of members of the Western cultures.

### What does cause the uncanny valley?
One of the approaches that aims to explain what happens when human interact with
increasingly human-like characters claims that the discomfort comes from the *perceptual
mismatch hypothesis* when a mismatch by inconsistent sensory cues (e.g. proportions of face
features doesn’t match skin texture).

On the other hand, *theory of mind* might offer another explanation. Research has shown that the most problematic parts causing uncanny valley are particularly face and eye-related areas. Humans are tuned in to detect even small changes in facial expressions and eye movement and surrounding areas are the facial features used to assess other people’s mental states through. When for example a smile doesn’t match human anatomy, humans subconsciously assess that there is something off with the person and might feel repulsed by them. Then the capacity to understand others through theory of mind can be limited.

Research also shows that there is an effect between the prior familiarity with a character and uncanny valley, where the curve tends to be moderate for those characters previously known by the subject.

### Why should I care?
In video games in particular, the demand for bridging the uncanny valley by creating
highly realistic animations is of the utmost importance because it can hinder player’s immersion.
Also, to some extent it is the nature of game developers to challenge themselves and increase the
realism of the game world and characters inhabiting them.

Players detecting uncanny valley while playing game tend to drop from the state of immersion. Immersion is a complex cognitive state so it might be broken by a myriad of things but when you’re developing a game with realistic human-like looking and behaving characters, this is not the way how you want to loose them.

### How do I apply what I just read in the game development?
One of the ways to bypass this problem is to go through the path of stylization. Some of
the elements of stylization that have the greatest impact on the attractiveness of characters are
material properties or figures, the shape of characters determines mainly how realistic they
appear. Sometimes uncanny valley is even desirable, especially in creation of
deliberately repulsive characters.

As humans interact more with software agents, and come to rely on them more, it becomes increasingly important that the systems rely on the same interactional rules that humans do. The goal should not be “to make every interface anthropomorphic but the principles of spatialized interaction and embodied conversational agents might helpfully locate intelligence for users” [Cassell et al., 2000; Cassell, 2001]. Although believability is often named as the primary purpose behind embodying the interface, functions and properly conveyed social cues would appear to be more effective.


Test it and test it early. Especially the animation part will be the trickiest to manage.

Creating, modeling and animating realistic human-like characters is immensely hard! With the progressively better technology, game studios do their best to deliver the best possible NPCs to their players. However, this not always goes according to the plan. Here are some of the examples of uncanny valley creeping out people, and further down you’ll find ones that players agreed upon to be not as creepy.
