**Disclaimer:** This is not at all a guide on how to break into the game industry or how to become a stellar level designer in a short period of time. All materials listed here, as well as my personal notes, should serve as a repository of sources and recommendations.

In the best possible scenario, this post will give you an idea of where to go next and what's ahead in the domain of level design. I put it all together because I wish I had something like this when I started my own journey.

You will find everything below. Enjoy!

*The difference between these two pictures is 3 months. The first one is my first 5 hours long and lousy effort to build a centerpiece with a fountain in Unreal Engine 4 in April 2022. The second picture shows a stealth level I built in UE5 during a level design challenge happening in June, using my own design, gameplay scenario and basic encounter design.*

## > Level design theory
I’ve noticed that what makes a level designer stand out is not only years of practice and games they’ve played (and sub/conciouslz analyzed along the way) but also the theoretical background they’ve obtained in game design or fields related to it. It does make a big difference when you know your “whys”. Which sources are worth engaging with, though?

Game design as a field is backed up by a substantial body of theories coming from psychology, architecture, sociology, information technology, and other domains. Game design pretty much borrows something from everywhere. You don’t have to master each of the fields, nor do you have to read academic papers produced by scholars. However, your willingness to learn about even the basic concepts from different sources will pay off.

In general, any literature discussing design and psychology, including but not limited to cognitive processes (memory, learning, motivation), how people react to shapes (gestalt theory) and colors (color theory) will be immensely helpful when building levels and navigating players through them in a satisfying way.

Here’s a list what I recommend to read, listen to or watch.

### Books & Articles
The myriad of resources available these days about game design can feel indimidating. My origins are in academia, so I tend to blend both research-based books and practice-oriented ones to get the maximum out of what I read. I also understand that not everyone is a fan of research books, as approachable as they tend to be lately. Don't worry, all of the below books are accesible and highly enjoyable, so...choose your proverbial poison!

##### Game design & Level design
Most of the game design books talk about why people play, what games are and how people design them; what is the general mentality of players, what they expect, and what keeps them in the loop despite failing. Level design books talk specifically about what level design is, how to approach it, formalize it and get better at it. These are one of my favorites and also seminal works for understanding what we mean when we say game design.

##### Design
Some of these books are a design canon and explain what design and design thinking is. Since players use mental models and maps to orient themselves in gamespaces, I've also included books about the topic. Some color theory is also handy to know about.

- Donald Norman: The Design of Everyday Things
- Donald Norman: Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things
- Eli Woolery: Design Thinking Handbook
- Indi Young: Mental Models: Aligning Design Strategy with Human Behavior
- Peter Gould: Mental Maps
- Steve Krug: Don’t Make Me Think
- Susan Weinschenk: 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People
- A. & J. Eckstut: The Secret Language of Color

##### UX Research & Psychology
Building levels is basically all about being cognizant of various principles of human psychology and being able to leverage them. Celia Hodent’s books are essential to understand gamer’s psychology and how the mind drives their perception and behavior.

- Celia Hodent: The Psychology of Video Games
- Celia Hodent: The Gamer’s Brain: How Neuroscience and UX Can Impact Video Game Design
- Celia Hodent: What UX is Really About
- Jamie Madigan: Getting Gamers: The Psychology of Video Games and Their Impact on the People who Play Them
- Rudolf Arnheim: Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye
- Anders Drachen: Game User Research

##### Architecture & Urbanism & Level Design
Level design means you’re inevitably signing up for learning bits about architecture, interior design and urbanism. These books should help with it. (101 Things I Learned series was recommend to me by MT)

- Alison Gazzard: Mazes in Videogames: Meaning, Metaphor, and Design
- Christopher W. Totten: Architectural Approach to Level Design
- Von Borries: Space Time Play: Computer Games, Architecture and Urbanism: The Next Level
- Matthew Frederick: 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School
- Matthew Frederick & Vikas Mehta: 101 Things I Learned in Urban Design School

##### Ethical game design & Representation
Designing anything comes with a great responsibility. I’m not joking. Designers implement values in what they create automatically, quite often without thinking about it. Knowing that games have embedded values and how to design with them in mind is important, so is knowing about representation in video games.

- Karen Schrier: Ethics and Game Design: Teaching Values Through Play
- Flanagan & Nissenbaum: Values at Play in Digital Games
- Mike Monteiro: Ruined By Design: How Designers Destroyed the World, and What We Can Do to Fix It
- Adrienne Shaw: Gaming at the Edge: Sexuality and Gender at the Margins of Gamer Culture
- Shira Chess: Ready Player Two: Women Players and Designed Identity

### Streamers & Content Creators

#### YouTube & Twitch channels
All hail YouTube, the place where people explain everything in a fun way! (Unless you end up in a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories…). Most of the resources I watch talk about game design, AI in video games, and some specifically focus on level design. I've also added channels of Game User Research Special Interest Group (GRUX SIG) because they often share their findings about players which are essential to know about when designing.

## > Tools & workflow
As I said before, everyone’s path is different and so will be the tools you'll use and your workflow. There's no industry standard (as far as I know) how one goes about designing a level but some parts of the process will common to everyone. Below is the rough idea of how I approach it. It might or might not  

![](/images/posts/tools.png)

#### Pen & paper
Planning to do a 3D level? Start with sketching. As soon as you have an idea, try to put it on paper. It doesn’t have to be perfect (look at my rough sketch below, a three year old could make a better one) but it should give you an idea what you’re working towards. You’ll get a general idea about dimensions, division of space, where you want your objectives or enemies to be placed, etc. 100% you will move away from the original draft, but the first sketch will help to ground you.

#### Moodboard

#### Engine
Choose your weap…engine wisely. Before I started working in Unreal Engine 5 because of its rising prevalence in the industry, my weapon of choice was Unity. I was mostly learning how to script in it but for whatever reason Unity just wasn’t working for me building level-wise. It was too cumbersome. Switching to Unreal has made all the difference. You might be a Unity person, maybe you prefer Unreal, or Godot will work better for you. If you’re into 2D, there are options like Construct. Try a couple of them and you’ll see which one is the best for you. It’s also totally okay if you stick with building paper models…

Also, each of the tools is supported by communities and tutorials on every aspect of working with one of the engines can be easily found either via their product’s official websites or on YouTube, Udemy or Coursera.

#### Blockout tools
Blockout is the process of using basic objects (“blockmeshes”) provided by the engine to create a waterdown version of a level you plan to build. Think, gray boxes put together to create a space like this one.

I learned the hard way that in blockout, less is always more. Initially, I thought I should use all the intricate and detailed 3D assets I can buy. What often happened was that instead of building a level I ended up decorating it. Teach your brain to think in basic shapes and use them to create a space you want, details included. Don’t have a table? Use a rectangle of the same length and height. Don’t have bar stools? Use cones. Rinse. Repeat. The main goal of blocking out is to convey information in the cleanest way possible. You can always add the rest later.

Also if you’re interested to see how detailed or abstract a blockout can be, I recommend following hashtag #Blocktober and a Twitter handle @BlocktoberLD. Every year during October, level designers from around the world participate in this challenge and showcase their work.

## > Find your community
“None of us should wander alone, you least of all.” 
Boromir, The Lord of The Rings

You don’t necessarily need to be a fantasy book character to know that everything is better with the right companion. Learning level or game design can become a lonely activity -- it’s up to you and your way around the tools to create something from scratch. It takes hours, even days and weeks to master software tools, compose your ideas and iterate on them. During this process, one can become quite lonely.

All this time is enough for your mind to start doubting. At some point, there will be the imposter syndrome lurking, and telling you you suck and should give up. Your brain will come up with doubts about your abilities, creativity and if it’s all worth it. You will inevitably try to compare your beginner work with others, while forgetting that you’ve barely started, whereas their careers span over decades. Having a friend or a couple of them will be your fail-safe during the times you want to give up or when everything becomes a little too heavy.

I personally found my level design online home and like-minded people within a Tostserver, a Discord server run by Miles Tost who is a senior level designer at CD Projekt Red. You might have heard of the studio; I believe they made somewhat popular games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077…

All jokes aside, Tostserver is a small but vibrant community of people from all around the world who either want to become game devs, and are relentlessly working towards the goal, or are interested in video games in general. If you're ever in need of a positive and supporting, sometimes a tiny bit chaotic community, come and join us! We have cats and potatoes…

Some other communities worth being part of:

The Design Den Discord - https://t.co/51xNJsI0Ak
GameDev.Tv Discord - https://discord.gg/gamedevtv 

## > Create, create, create

## > Get yourself a mentor
You have all the tools, you figured out your workflow, you’re creating levels but how do you know that you’re improving or if your creations make sense at all? One way you can go about it is by letting people playtest what you put together. Be it family, friends or complete strangers, you can upload your game files on itch.io and share a link. But the best thing you can possibly do if you are serious about your craft is to find yourself a mentor.

### A personal note before we part our ways
Back in April, I was adamantly convinced that I don’t have a speck of design thinking in me and am artistically dumb as clay. I thought using tools such as Unreal Engine 5 was beyond my scope and learning abilities. I vividly remember telling a couple of game devs at GDC 2022 that I know nothing about gamedev, and the only skills I possess is reading academic books about game design. But I wanted to learn how game worlds are built. I wanted to learn about level design. I wanted to build those levels, too.

As simple as that, my level design journey started. I’ve become a sponge, absorbing anything and everything you possibly can throw at me about telegraphing, signposting, level design, game design and UX principles applicable to building spaces for players to play in.

Three months later from, I am a bit further on my journey. I've landed a game design internship at Warhorse Studios, but I still have so, so much to learn. As we speak I'm barely bridging the gaping gap of being a total noob to becoming a junior level designer. But I’ve been told I am good at it, so I’ll keep leveling up.

Along the way, I’ve built a **database of resources, discovered awesome communities and built a network of people that have helped me**, both directly and indirectly, with becoming a (baby) level designer. As I said, **this post is all about appreciating those connections and sharing all the resources with others**.

Where you go and what you learn in the process of level design is up to you, your own efforts, commitment and hard work. Mind you, everyone's path is different, and I sincerely hope yours is as joyful and exciting as mine has been. So, please, have fun & enjoy it! If I could pull this level design adventure off, you can too!
