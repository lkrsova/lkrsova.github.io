Crafting systems are an essential set of mechanics of most modern games, including Minecraft, a myriad of survival games, or cozy and fluffy farming sims like Stardew Valley. As much as it crafts (pun intended!) a wholesome experience for a player, it can cause an extra cognitive burden for a player. 

### Crafting systems
Crafting systems is a collection of game mechanics which allow a player to build virtual objects within a game. Since it enables a player to interact with objects to create something new, useful or necessary to advance a gameplay, it is a fairly common system implemented in most modern games. If it's a good or bad thing is up to the reader's discretion.

Examples of using a crafting system range from making tools like a pickaxe or sword to building machines and elaborate structures placable in the gameworld. A player either follows a set of recipes or is given a free hand in figuring out combinations of materials or objects to create something new[^1]. When a player gathers enough materials listed in a recipe they build an object accordingly. Rinse. Repeat.

In some cases a player needs to wait a certain amount of time for an object to be created and fully usable within the game world. As a matter of fact this waiting time can be perceived in different dimensions, real-world time and game world time being just two of them[^2].

Different virtual objects also require different types and amount of resources to be crafted. Some recipes are straightforward and combine only two ingredients, whereas others are complex and require way more ingredients, effort and time as well.  

### Cognitive load 
Ideally, the crafting systems are designed in a way that a player's cognitive overload of remembering which ingredients are necessary to build something is limited. However, it's not always the case and it can be detrimental to enjoying the game. Why is a cognitive overload a problem anyways?

A video game UX researcher Celia Hodent writes in her book The Gamer's Brain[^3] about how short-term memory has a very limited capacity in time. She also mentions that for the gaming the most important memory is the working one.

Some useful facst for the starters. More or less, people can store up to 7 items in their short-term memory span. People also tend to remmeber the first and the last item from a given list. Meaning, if you give a player way more things they must remember in order to accomplish something in-game, you might "fry" their brain a bit and overload it.

On a cognitive level, crafting can also reinforce analytical thinking and a feeling of happiness. Even in the physical world crafting is a creative endeavor present in many variations. People tend to do it to have a pleasurable experience of creating something from scratch. If crafting is not going our way or we feel inadequate by not mastering the craft, we tend to be unhappy about it, question our own capabilities, and some might potentially drop the whole craft altogether.

What is the main difference from the physical world crafting and the virtual world crafting is in the cognitive load. In physical world, crafting
